# fundraising
Many people suffer from unexpected problems in their life. Fundraising is a way to make the financial situation better. In this project, I have analysed the people's story in the gofundme website, such as, what kind of common issues are there(which might help government and charity organization to design their policy) and what kind of word choices/sentiments help people to increase the fundraising amount.
